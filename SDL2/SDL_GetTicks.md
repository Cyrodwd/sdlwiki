# SDL_GetTicks

Get the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_timer.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_timer.h)

## Syntax

```c
Uint32 SDL_GetTicks(void);
```

## Return Value

(Uint32) Returns an unsigned 32-bit value representing the number of
milliseconds since the SDL library initialized.

## Remarks

This value wraps if the program runs for more than ~49 days.

This function is not recommended as of SDL 2.0.18; use
[SDL_GetTicks64](SDL_GetTicks64)() instead, where the value doesn't wrap
every ~49 days. There are places in SDL where we provide a 32-bit timestamp
that can not change without breaking binary compatibility, though, so this
function isn't officially deprecated.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
