# SDL_GameControllerRumbleTriggers

Start a rumble effect in the game controller's triggers.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_gamecontroller.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_gamecontroller.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GameControllerRumbleTriggers(SDL_GameController *gamecontroller, Uint16 left_rumble, Uint16 right_rumble, Uint32 duration_ms);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                            |                    |                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [SDL_GameController](SDL_GameController) * | **gamecontroller** | The controller to vibrate.                                         |
| Uint16                                     | **left_rumble**    | The intensity of the left trigger rumble motor, from 0 to 0xFFFF.  |
| Uint16                                     | **right_rumble**   | The intensity of the right trigger rumble motor, from 0 to 0xFFFF. |
| Uint32                                     | **duration_ms**    | The duration of the rumble effect, in milliseconds.                |

## Return Value

(int) Returns 0, or -1 if trigger rumble isn't supported on this
controller.

## Remarks

Each call to this function cancels any previous trigger rumble effect, and
calling it with 0 intensity stops any rumbling.

Note that this is rumbling of the _triggers_ and not the game controller as
a whole. This is currently only supported on Xbox One controllers. If you
want the (more common) whole-controller rumble, use
[SDL_GameControllerRumble](SDL_GameControllerRumble)() instead.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.14.
