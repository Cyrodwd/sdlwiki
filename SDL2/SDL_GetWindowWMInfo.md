# SDL_GetWindowWMInfo

Get driver-specific information about a window.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_syswm.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_syswm.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_GetWindowWMInfo(SDL_Window * window,
                             SDL_SysWMinfo * info);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                  |            |                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) *       | **window** | the window about which information is being requested.                         |
| [SDL_SysWMinfo](SDL_SysWMinfo) * | **info**   | an [SDL_SysWMinfo](SDL_SysWMinfo) structure filled in with window information. |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if the function is
implemented and the `version` member of the `info` struct is valid, or
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) if the information could not be retrieved; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

You must include [SDL_syswm](SDL_syswm).h for the declaration of
[SDL_SysWMinfo](SDL_SysWMinfo).

The caller must initialize the `info` structure's version by using
`SDL_VERSION(&info.version)`, and then this function will fill in the rest
of the structure with information about the given window.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
