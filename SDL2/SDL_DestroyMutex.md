# SDL_DestroyMutex

Destroy a mutex created with [SDL_CreateMutex](SDL_CreateMutex)().

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_mutex.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_mutex.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_DestroyMutex(SDL_mutex * mutex);
```

## Function Parameters

|                          |           |                       |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------------- |
| [SDL_mutex](SDL_mutex) * | **mutex** | the mutex to destroy. |

## Remarks

This function must be called on any mutex that is no longer needed. Failure
to destroy a mutex will result in a system memory or resource leak. While
it is safe to destroy a mutex that is _unlocked_, it is not safe to attempt
to destroy a locked mutex, and may result in undefined behavior depending
on the platform.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
