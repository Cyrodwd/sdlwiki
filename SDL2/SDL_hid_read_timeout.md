## Syntax

```

## Function Parameters

|                                    |                  |                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_hid_device](SDL_hid_device) * | **dev**          | A device handle returned from [SDL_hid_open](SDL_hid_open)().                                                          |
| unsigned char *                    | **data**         | A buffer to put the read data into.                                                                                    |
| size_t                             | **length**       | The number of bytes to read. For devices with multiple reports, make sure to read an extra byte for the report number. |
| int                                | **milliseconds** | timeout in milliseconds or -1 for blocking wait.                                                                       |

## Return Value

(int) Returns the actual number of bytes read and -1 on error. If no packet
was available to be read within the timeout period, this function returns
0.

## Remarks

Input reports are returned to the host through the INTERRUPT IN endpoint.
The first byte will contain the Report number if the device uses numbered
reports.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
