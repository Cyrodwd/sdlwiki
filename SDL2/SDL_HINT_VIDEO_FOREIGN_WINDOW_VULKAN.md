# SDL_HINT_VIDEO_FOREIGN_WINDOW_VULKAN

When calling [SDL_CreateWindowFrom](SDL_CreateWindowFrom)(), make the window compatible with Vulkan.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_FOREIGN_WINDOW_VULKAN "SDL_VIDEO_FOREIGN_WINDOW_VULKAN"
```

## Remarks

This variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": Don't add any graphics flags to the
  [SDL_WindowFlags](SDL_WindowFlags)
- "1": Add [SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN](SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN) to the
  [SDL_WindowFlags](SDL_WindowFlags)

By default SDL will not make the foreign window compatible with Vulkan.
