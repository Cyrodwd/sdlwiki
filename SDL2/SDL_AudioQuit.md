# SDL_AudioQuit

Use this function to shut down audio if you initialized it with [SDL_AudioInit](SDL_AudioInit)().

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_audio.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_AudioQuit(void);
```

## Remarks

This function is used internally, and should not be used unless you have a
specific need to specify the audio driver you want to use. You should
normally use [SDL_Quit](SDL_Quit)() or
[SDL_QuitSubSystem](SDL_QuitSubSystem)().
