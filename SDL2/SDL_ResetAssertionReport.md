# SDL_ResetAssertionReport

Clear the list of all assertion failures.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_assert.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_assert.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_ResetAssertionReport(void);
```

## Remarks

This function will clear the list of all assertions triggered up to that
point. Immediately following this call,
[SDL_GetAssertionReport](SDL_GetAssertionReport) will return no items. In
addition, any previously-triggered assertions will be reset to a
trigger_count of zero, and their always_ignore state will be false.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
