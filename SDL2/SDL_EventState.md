# SDL_EventState

Set the state of processing events by type.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_events.h)

## Syntax

```c
Uint8 SDL_EventState(Uint32 type, int state);
```

## Function Parameters

|        |           |                                                                    |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Uint32 | **type**  | the type of event; see [SDL_EventType](SDL_EventType) for details. |
| int    | **state** | how to process the event.                                          |

## Return Value

(Uint8) Returns [`SDL_DISABLE`](SDL_DISABLE) or [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE),
representing the processing state of the event before this function makes
any changes to it.

## Remarks

`state` may be any of the following:

- [`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY): returns the current processing state of the
  specified event
- [`SDL_IGNORE`](SDL_IGNORE) (aka [`SDL_DISABLE`](SDL_DISABLE)): the event
  will automatically be dropped from the event queue and will not be
  filtered
- [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE): the event will be processed normally

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
