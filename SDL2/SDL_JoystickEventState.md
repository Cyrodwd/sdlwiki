# SDL_JoystickEventState

Enable/disable joystick event polling.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_joystick.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_joystick.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_JoystickEventState(int state);
```

## Function Parameters

|     |           |                                                                                                    |
| --- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int | **state** | can be one of [`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY), [`SDL_IGNORE`](SDL_IGNORE), or [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE). |

## Return Value

(int) Returns If `state` is [`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY) then the current state
is returned, otherwise `state` is returned (even if it was not one of the
allowed values).

## Remarks

If joystick events are disabled, you must call
[SDL_JoystickUpdate](SDL_JoystickUpdate)() yourself and manually check the
state of the joystick when you want joystick information.

It is recommended that you leave joystick event handling enabled.

**WARNING**: Calling this function may delete all events currently in SDL's
event queue.

While `param` is meant to be one of [`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY),
[`SDL_IGNORE`](SDL_IGNORE), or [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE), this function
accepts any value, with any non-zero value that isn't
[`SDL_QUERY`](SDL_QUERY) being treated as [`SDL_ENABLE`](SDL_ENABLE).

If SDL was built with events disabled (extremely uncommon!), this will do
nothing and always return [`SDL_IGNORE`](SDL_IGNORE).

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
