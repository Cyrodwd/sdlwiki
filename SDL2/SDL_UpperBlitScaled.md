# SDL_UpperBlitScaled

Perform a scaled surface copy to a destination surface.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_surface.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_surface.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_UpperBlitScaled
    (SDL_Surface * src, const SDL_Rect * srcrect,
    SDL_Surface * dst, SDL_Rect * dstrect);


#define SDL_BlitScaled SDL_UpperBlitScaled
```

## Remarks

[SDL_UpperBlitScaled](SDL_UpperBlitScaled)() has been replaced by
[SDL_BlitScaled](SDL_BlitScaled)(), which is merely a macro for this
function with a less confusing name.
