# SDL_SetWindowInputFocus

Explicitly set input focus to the window.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_video.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SetWindowInputFocus(SDL_Window * window);
```

## Function Parameters

|                            |            |                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) * | **window** | the window that should get the input focus. |

## Return Value

(int) Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

You almost certainly want [SDL_RaiseWindow](SDL_RaiseWindow)() instead of
this function. Use this with caution, as you might give focus to a window
that is completely obscured by other windows.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.5.
