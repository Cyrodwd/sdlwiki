# SDL_JoystickOpen

Open a joystick for use.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_joystick.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_joystick.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Joystick* SDL_JoystickOpen(int device_index);
```

## Function Parameters

|     |                  |                                     |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| int | **device_index** | the index of the joystick to query. |

## Return Value

([SDL_Joystick](SDL_Joystick) *) Returns a joystick identifier or NULL if
an error occurred; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more
information.

## Remarks

The `device_index` argument refers to the N'th joystick presently
recognized by SDL on the system. It is **NOT** the same as the instance ID
used to identify the joystick in future events. See
[SDL_JoystickInstanceID](SDL_JoystickInstanceID)() for more details about
instance IDs.

The joystick subsystem must be initialized before a joystick can be opened
for use.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
