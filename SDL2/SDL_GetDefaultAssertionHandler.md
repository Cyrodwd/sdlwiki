# SDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler

Get the default assertion handler.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_assert.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_assert.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_AssertionHandler SDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler(void);
```

## Return Value

([SDL_AssertionHandler](SDL_AssertionHandler)) Returns the default
[SDL_AssertionHandler](SDL_AssertionHandler) that is called when an assert
triggers.

## Remarks

This returns the function pointer that is called by default when an
assertion is triggered. This is an internal function provided by SDL, that
is used for assertions when
[SDL_SetAssertionHandler](SDL_SetAssertionHandler)() hasn't been used to
provide a different function.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.2.
