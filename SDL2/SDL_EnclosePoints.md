# SDL_EnclosePoints

Calculate a minimal rectangle enclosing a set of points.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_rect.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_rect.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_EnclosePoints(const SDL_Point * points,
                           int count,
                           const SDL_Rect * clip,
                           SDL_Rect * result);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                |            |                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| const [SDL_Point](SDL_Point) * | **points** | an array of [SDL_Point](SDL_Point) structures representing points to be enclosed. |
| int                            | **count**  | the number of structures in the `points` array.                                   |
| const [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) *   | **clip**   | an [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) used for clipping or NULL to enclose all points.          |
| [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) *         | **result** | an [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) structure filled in with the minimal enclosing rectangle. |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if any points were
enclosed or [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) if all the points were outside of the
clipping rectangle.

## Remarks

If `clip` is not NULL then only points inside of the clipping rectangle are
considered.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
