# SDL_GetNumTouchDevices

Get the number of registered touch devices.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_touch.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_touch.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetNumTouchDevices(void);
```

## Return Value

(int) Returns the number of registered touch devices.

## Remarks

On some platforms SDL first sees the touch device if it was actually used.
Therefore [SDL_GetNumTouchDevices](SDL_GetNumTouchDevices)() may return 0
although devices are available. After using all devices at least once the
number will be correct.

This was fixed for Android in SDL 2.0.1.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
