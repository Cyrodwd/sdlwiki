# SDL_MouseWheelEvent

Mouse wheel event structure (event.wheel.*)

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_events.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_MouseWheelEvent
{
    Uint32 type;        /**< SDL_MOUSEWHEEL */
    Uint32 timestamp;   /**< In milliseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicks() */
    Uint32 windowID;    /**< The window with mouse focus, if any */
    Uint32 which;       /**< The mouse instance id, or SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID */
    Sint32 x;           /**< The amount scrolled horizontally, positive to the right and negative to the left */
    Sint32 y;           /**< The amount scrolled vertically, positive away from the user and negative toward the user */
    Uint32 direction;   /**< Set to one of the SDL_MOUSEWHEEL_* defines. When FLIPPED the values in X and Y will be opposite. Multiply by -1 to change them back */
    float preciseX;     /**< The amount scrolled horizontally, positive to the right and negative to the left, with float precision (added in 2.0.18) */
    float preciseY;     /**< The amount scrolled vertically, positive away from the user and negative toward the user, with float precision (added in 2.0.18) */
    Sint32 mouseX;      /**< X coordinate, relative to window (added in 2.26.0) */
    Sint32 mouseY;      /**< Y coordinate, relative to window (added in 2.26.0) */
} SDL_MouseWheelEvent;
