## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_ResetHint(const char *name);
```

## Function Parameters

|              |          |                  |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| const char * | **name** | the hint to set. |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if the hint was set,

change.
