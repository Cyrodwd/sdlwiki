# SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize

Get the size of the window's underlying drawable dimensions in pixels.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_vulkan.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_vulkan.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window * window,
                                int *w, int *h);
```

## Function Parameters

|                            |            |                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) * | **window** | an [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) for which the size is to be queried. |
| int *                      | **w**      | Pointer to the variable to write the width to or NULL.           |
| int *                      | **h**      | Pointer to the variable to write the height to or NULL.          |

## Remarks

This may differ from [SDL_GetWindowSize](SDL_GetWindowSize)() if we're
rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with
[`SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI`](SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI) on a platform with
high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the
[`SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED`](SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED) hint.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.6.
