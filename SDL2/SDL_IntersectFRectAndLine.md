# SDL_IntersectFRectAndLine

Calculate the intersection of a rectangle and line segment with float precision.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_rect.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_rect.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_IntersectFRectAndLine(const SDL_FRect *
                                   rect, float *X1,
                                   float *Y1, float *X2,
                                   float *Y2);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                |          |                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| const [SDL_FRect](SDL_FRect) * | **rect** | an [SDL_FRect](SDL_FRect) structure representing the rectangle to intersect. |
| float *                        | **X1**   | a pointer to the starting X-coordinate of the line.                          |
| float *                        | **Y1**   | a pointer to the starting Y-coordinate of the line.                          |
| float *                        | **X2**   | a pointer to the ending X-coordinate of the line.                            |
| float *                        | **Y2**   | a pointer to the ending Y-coordinate of the line.                            |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if there is an
intersection, [SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) otherwise.

## Remarks

This function is used to clip a line segment to a rectangle. A line segment
contained entirely within the rectangle or that does not intersect will
remain unchanged. A line segment that crosses the rectangle at either or
both ends will be clipped to the boundary of the rectangle and the new
coordinates saved in `X1`, `Y1`, `X2`, and/or `Y2` as necessary.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 2.0.22.
