# Mix_RewindMusic

Rewind the music stream.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/main/include/SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
void Mix_RewindMusic(void);
```

## Remarks

This causes the currently-playing music to start mixing from the beginning
of the music, as if it were just started.

It's a legal no-op to rewind the music stream when not playing.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
