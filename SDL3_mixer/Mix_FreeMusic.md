## Syntax

```c
void Mix_FreeMusic(Mix_Music *music);

## Function Parameters

|                          |           |                           |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| [Mix_Music](Mix_Music) * | **music** | the music object to free. |

## Remarks

If this music is currently playing, it will be stopped.

If this music is in the process of fading out (via
[Mix_FadeOutMusic](Mix_FadeOutMusic)()), this function will *block* until
the fade completes. If you need to avoid this, be sure to call
[Mix_HaltMusic](Mix_HaltMusic)() before freeing the music.
