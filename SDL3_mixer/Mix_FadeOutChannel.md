# Mix_FadeOutChannel

Halt a channel after fading it out for a specified time.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/main/include/SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_FadeOutChannel(int which, int ms);
```

## Function Parameters

|     |           |                                                            |
| --- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| int | **which** | the channel to fade out.                                   |
| int | **ms**    | number of milliseconds to fade before halting the channel. |

## Return Value

(int) Returns the number of channels scheduled to fade.

## Remarks

This will begin a channel fading from its current volume to silence over
`ms` milliseconds. After that time, the channel is halted.

Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by
[Mix_ChannelFinished](Mix_ChannelFinished)() once the halt occurs.

A fading channel will change it's volume progressively, as if
[Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume)() was called on it (which is to say: you probably
shouldn't call [Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume)() on a fading channel).

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the chunk to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
