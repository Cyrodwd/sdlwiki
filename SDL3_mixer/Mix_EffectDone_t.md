###### (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.)
# Mix_EffectDone_t

This is a callback that signifies that a channel has finished all its loops and has completed playback.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/main/include/SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef void (SDLCALL *Mix_EffectDone_t)(int chan, void *udata);
```

## Remarks

This gets called if the buffer plays out normally, or if you call
[Mix_HaltChannel](Mix_HaltChannel)(), implicitly stop a channel via
[Mix_AllocateChannels](Mix_AllocateChannels)(), or unregister a callback
while it's still playing.

DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
