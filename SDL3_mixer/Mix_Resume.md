# Mix_Resume

Resume a particular channel.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/main/include/SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
void Mix_Resume(int channel);
```

## Function Parameters

|     |             |                                                             |
| --- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| int | **channel** | the channel to resume, or -1 to resume all paused channels. |

## Remarks

It is legal to resume an unpaused or invalid channel; it causes no effect
and reports no error.

If the paused channel has an expiration, its expiration countdown resumes
now, as well.

Specifying a channel of -1 will resume _all_ paused channels. Any music is
unaffected.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
