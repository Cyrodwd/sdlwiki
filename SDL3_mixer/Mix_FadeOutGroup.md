# Mix_FadeOutGroup

Halt a playing group of channels by arbitrary tag, after fading them out for a specified time.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/blob/main/include/SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h)

## Syntax

```c
int Mix_FadeOutGroup(int tag, int ms);
```

## Function Parameters

|     |         |                                                          |
| --- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| int | **tag** | an arbitrary value, assigned to channels, to search for. |
| int | **ms**  | number of milliseconds to fade before halting the group. |

## Return Value

(int) Returns the number of channels that were scheduled for fading.

## Remarks

This will begin fading a group of channels with a specific tag from their
current volumes to silence over `ms` milliseconds. After that time, those
channels are halted.

A tag is an arbitrary number that can be assigned to several mixer
channels, to form groups of channels.

The default tag for a channel is -1.

Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by
[Mix_ChannelFinished](Mix_ChannelFinished)() once the halt occurs.

A fading channel will change it's volume progressively, as if
[Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume)() was called on it (which is to say: you probably
shouldn't call [Mix_Volume](Mix_Volume)() on a fading channel).

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the group to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately.

## Version

This function is available since SDL_mixer 3.0.0.
