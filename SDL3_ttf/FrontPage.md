# SDL_ttf 3.0

This is the SDL3 wiki. SDL2 is [over here](/SDL2_ttf)!

## What is it?

This library is a wrapper around the FreeType and Harfbuzz libraries, allowing you to use TrueType fonts to render text in SDL applications.

This library is distributed under the [zlib license](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php). This license allows you to use it freely in any software.

This library also uses the following libraries:
- FreeType, licensed under the [FTL](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/blob/master/docs/FTL.TXT)
- HarfBuzz, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/COPYING)
- PlutoSVG, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/sammycage/plutosvg/blob/master/LICENSE)
- PlutoVG, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/sammycage/plutovg/blob/master/LICENSE)

Please follow the licenses of any fonts you include in your application, as many of them are copyrighted. The Microsoft fonts, for example, are not freely redistributable.
