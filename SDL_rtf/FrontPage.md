# SDL_rtf 2.0

This library allows you to display simple Rich Text Format (RTF) files in SDL applications.

The RTF format specification is available at [windows.net](https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/Archive_References/%5bMSFT-RTF%5d.pdf).

The showrtf example application relies on the [SDL_ttf library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) for loading
fonts and displaying text.

To make the library, type './configure' then 'make' to build the SDL rtf library and the showrtf example application.

This library is under the zlib license, see the file [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_rtf/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) for details.

A list of API function is available at [CategoryAPI](CategoryAPI).
