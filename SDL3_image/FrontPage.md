# SDL_image 3.0

This is the SDL3 wiki. SDL2 is [over here](/SDL2_image)!

## What is it?

This is a simple library to load images of various formats as SDL surfaces.
It can load BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM (PPM/PGM/PBM), QOI, TGA, XCF, XPM, and simple SVG format images. It can also load AVIF, JPEG-XL, TIFF, and WebP images, depending on build options.

SDL_image 3.0 (often shortened to "SDL3_image") is distributed under the
[zlib license](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php). This license allows you
to use SDL_image freely in any software.
