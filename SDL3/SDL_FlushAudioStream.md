# SDL_FlushAudioStream

Tell the stream that you're done sending data, and anything being buffered should be converted/resampled and made available immediately.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_audio.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_FlushAudioStream(SDL_AudioStream *stream);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                      |            |                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| [SDL_AudioStream](SDL_AudioStream) * | **stream** | the audio stream to flush. |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true on success or false on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

It is legal to add more data to a stream after flushing, but there may be
audio gaps in the output. Generally this is intended to signal the end of
input, so the complete output becomes available.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
