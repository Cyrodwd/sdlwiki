# SDL_GetWindowPixelDensity

Get the pixel density of a window.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_video.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
float SDL_GetWindowPixelDensity(SDL_Window *window);
```

## Function Parameters

|                            |            |                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) * | **window** | the window to query. |

## Return Value

(float) Returns the pixel density or 0.0f on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This is a ratio of pixel size to window size. For example, if the window is
1920x1080 and it has a high density back buffer of 3840x2160 pixels, it
would have a pixel density of 2.0.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
