# CategoryProcess

Process control support.

These functions provide a cross-platform way to spawn and manage OS-level
processes.

You can create a new subprocess with
[SDL_CreateProcess](SDL_CreateProcess)() and optionally read and write to
it using [SDL_ReadProcess](SDL_ReadProcess)() or
[SDL_GetProcessInput](SDL_GetProcessInput)() and
[SDL_GetProcessOutput](SDL_GetProcessOutput)(). If more advanced
functionality like chaining input between processes is necessary, you can
use [SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties](SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties)().

You can get the status of a created process with
[SDL_WaitProcess](SDL_WaitProcess)(), or terminate the process with
[SDL_KillProcess](SDL_KillProcess)().

Don't forget to call [SDL_DestroyProcess](SDL_DestroyProcess)() to clean
up, whether the process process was killed, terminated on its own, or is
still running!
