# Simple DirectMedia Layer 3.0

This is the SDL3 wiki. SDL2 is [over here](/SDL2)!

## Try it right now!

SDL3 has officially stabilized the API and ABI, and a preview release is available at
[the GitHub page](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/preview-3.1.8).
We will still be adding things to the API but not changing or removing anything, so it's
safe to start porting your projects from SDL2.

Need some motivation? Here's a list of [New Features](NewFeatures) that you can
enjoy today in SDL3!

## What is it?

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to
provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/Vulkan. It is used by video playback
software, emulators, and popular games including
[Valve](https://valvesoftware.com)'s award winning catalog and many
[Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) games.

SDL officially supports Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and several
other platforms.

SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and has bindings available for
several other languages, including C#, Python, and [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/sdl3).

SDL 3.0 (often shortened to "SDL3") is distributed under the
[zlib license](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php). This license allows you
to use SDL freely in any software.

This is the SDL wiki. SDL's main website is [libsdl.org](https://libsdl.org/).
