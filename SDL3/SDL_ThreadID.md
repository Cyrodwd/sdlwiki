# SDL_ThreadID

A unique numeric ID that identifies a thread.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_thread.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_thread.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef Uint64 SDL_ThreadID;
```

## Remarks

These are different from [SDL_Thread](SDL_Thread) objects, which are
generally what an application will operate on, but having a way to uniquely
identify a thread can be useful at times.

## Version

This datatype is available since SDL 3.0.0.
