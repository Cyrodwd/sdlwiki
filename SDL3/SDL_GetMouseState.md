# SDL_GetMouseState

Retrieve the current state of the mouse.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_mouse.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_mouse.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_MouseButtonFlags SDL_GetMouseState(float *x, float *y);
```

## Function Parameters

|         |       |                                                                             |
| ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| float * | **x** | the x coordinate of the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window. |
| float * | **y** | the y coordinate of the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window. |

## Return Value

([SDL_MouseButtonFlags](SDL_MouseButtonFlags)) Returns a 32-bit button
bitmask of the current button state.

## Remarks

The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can be
tested using the [SDL_BUTTON_MASK](SDL_BUTTON_MASK)(X) macro (where `X` is
generally 1 for the left, 2 for middle, 3 for the right button), and `x`
and `y` are set to the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window.
You can pass NULL for either `x` or `y`.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

## Code Examples

```c
float x, y;
Uint32 buttons;

SDL_PumpEvents();  // make sure we have the latest mouse state.

buttons = SDL_GetMouseState(&x, &y);

SDL_Log("Mouse cursor is at %f, %f", x, y);
if ((buttons & SDL_BUTTON_LMASK) != 0) {
    SDL_Log("Mouse Button 1 (left) is pressed.");
}
```
