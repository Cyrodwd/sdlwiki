# SDL_randf_r

Generate a uniform pseudo-random floating point number less than 1.0

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
float SDL_randf_r(Uint64 *state);
```

## Function Parameters

|          |           |                                                                     |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uint64 * | **state** | a pointer to the current random number state, this may not be NULL. |

## Return Value

(float) Returns a random value in the range of [0.0, 1.0).

## Remarks

If you want reproducible output, be sure to initialize with
[SDL_srand](SDL_srand)() first.

There are no guarantees as to the quality of the random sequence produced,
and this should not be used for security (cryptography, passwords) or where
money is on the line (loot-boxes, casinos). There are many random number
libraries available with different characteristics and you should pick one
of those to meet any serious needs.

## Thread Safety

This function is thread-safe, as long as the state pointer isn't shared
between threads.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
