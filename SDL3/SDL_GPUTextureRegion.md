## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_GPUTextureRegion
{
    SDL_GPUTexture *texture;  /**< The texture used in the copy operation. */
    Uint32 mip_level;         /**< The mip level index to transfer. */
    Uint32 layer;             /**< The layer index to transfer. */
    Uint32 x;                 /**< The left offset of the region. */
    Uint32 y;                 /**< The top offset of the region. */
    Uint32 z;                 /**< The front offset of the region. */
    Uint32 w;                 /**< The width of the region. */
    Uint32 h;                 /**< The height of the region. */
    Uint32 d;                 /**< The depth of the region. */
} SDL_GPUTextureRegion;
```
