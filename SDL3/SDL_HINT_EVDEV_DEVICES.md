## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_EVDEV_DEVICES "SDL_EVDEV_DEVICES"
```

## Remarks

The list of devices is in the form:

deviceclass:path[,deviceclass:path[,...]]

[SDL_UDEV_deviceclass](SDL_UDEV_deviceclass) and path is the full path to
