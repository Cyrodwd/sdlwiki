# SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_CLIP_INTERVAL

Controls how often SDL issues cursor confinement commands to the operating system while relative mode is active, in case the desired confinement state became out-of-sync due to interference from other running programs.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_CLIP_INTERVAL "SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE_CLIP_INTERVAL"
```

## Remarks

The variable can be integers representing milliseconds between each
refresh. A value of zero means SDL will not automatically refresh the
confinement. The default value varies depending on the operating system,
this variable might not have any effects on inapplicable platforms such as
those without a cursor.

This hint can be set anytime.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
