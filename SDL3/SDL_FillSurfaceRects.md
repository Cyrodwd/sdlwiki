# SDL_FillSurfaceRects

Perform a fast fill of a set of rectangles with a specific color.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_surface.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_surface.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_FillSurfaceRects(SDL_Surface *dst, const SDL_Rect *rects, int count, Uint32 color);
```

## Function Parameters

|                              |           |                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) * | **dst**   | the [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) structure that is the drawing target.    |
| const [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) * | **rects** | an array of [SDL_Rects](SDL_Rects) representing the rectangles to fill. |
| int                          | **count** | the number of rectangles in the array.                                  |
| Uint32                       | **color** | the color to fill with.                                                 |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true on success or false on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

`color` should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be
generated by [SDL_MapRGB](SDL_MapRGB)() or [SDL_MapRGBA](SDL_MapRGBA)(). If
the color value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply
filled with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via
[SDL_SetSurfaceClipRect](SDL_SetSurfaceClipRect)()), then this function
will fill based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and `rect`.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
