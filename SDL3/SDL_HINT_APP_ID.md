# SDL_HINT_APP_ID

A variable setting the app ID string.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_APP_ID "SDL_APP_ID"
```

## Remarks

This string is used by desktop compositors to identify and group windows
together, as well as match applications with associated desktop settings
and icons.

This will override
[SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_IDENTIFIER_STRING](SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_IDENTIFIER_STRING),
if set by the application.

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.2.0.

## (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is the current stable version. [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) was the previous version!)
