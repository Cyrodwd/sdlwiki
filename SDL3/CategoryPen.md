# CategoryPen

SDL pen event handling.

SDL provides an API for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser)
handling, e.g., for input and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile /
tablet devices.

To get started with pens, simply handle [SDL_EVENT_PEN_](SDL_EVENT_PEN_)*
events. When a pen starts providing input, SDL will assign it a unique
[SDL_PenID](SDL_PenID), which will remain for the life of the process, as
long as the pen stays connected.

Pens may provide more than simple touch input; they might have other axes,
such as pressure, tilt, rotation, etc.
