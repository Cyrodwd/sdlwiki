# SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties

Create a new thread with with the specified properties.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_thread.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_thread.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Thread * SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties(SDL_PropertiesID props);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                      |           |                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| [SDL_PropertiesID](SDL_PropertiesID) | **props** | the properties to use. |

## Return Value

([SDL_Thread](SDL_Thread) *) Returns an opaque pointer to the new thread
object on success, NULL if the new thread could not be created; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

These are the supported properties:

- [`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER):
  an [SDL_ThreadFunction](SDL_ThreadFunction) value that will be called at
  the start of the new thread's life. Required.
- [`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING):
  the name of the new thread, which might be available to debuggers.
  Optional, defaults to NULL.
- [`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER):
  an arbitrary app-defined pointer, which is passed to the entry function
  on the new thread, as its only parameter. Optional, defaults to NULL.
- [`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER):
  the size, in bytes, of the new thread's stack. Optional, defaults to 0
  (system-defined default).

SDL makes an attempt to report
[`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING)
to the system, so that debuggers can display it. Not all platforms support
this.

Thread naming is a little complicated: Most systems have very small limits
for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual
C++ 6.0 has _nine_!), and possibly other arbitrary rules. You'll have to
see what happens with your system's debugger. The name should be UTF-8 (but
using the naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet). There are no
requirements for thread naming conventions, so long as the string is
null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads

If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it
(truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available from
[SDL_GetThreadName](SDL_GetThreadName)().

The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with
[`SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`](SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER).
Zero means "use the system default" which might be wildly different between
platforms. x86 Linux generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded
device might be a few kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a
stack that is a multiple of the system's page size (in many cases, this is
4 kilobytes, but check your system documentation).

Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
headers will need to deal with this.

The actual symbol in SDL is
[`SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime`](SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime),
so there is no symbol clash, but trying to load an SDL shared library and
look for "[SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties](SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties)"
will fail.

Usually, apps should just call this function the same way on every platform
and let the macros hide the details.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
