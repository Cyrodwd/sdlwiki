# SDL_log

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
double SDL_log(double x);
```

## Function Parameters

|        |       |                                               |
| ------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| double | **x** | floating point value. Must be greater than 0. |

## Return Value

(double) Returns the natural logarithm of `x`.

## Remarks

Domain: `0 < x <= INF`

Range: `-INF <= y <= INF`

It is an error for `x` to be less than or equal to 0.

This function operates on double-precision floating point values, use
[SDL_logf](SDL_logf) for single-precision floats.

This function may use a different approximation across different versions,
platforms and configurations. i.e, it can return a different value given
the same input on different machines or operating systems, or if SDL is
updated.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
