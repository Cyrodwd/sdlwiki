# SDL_PLATFORM_LINUX

A preprocessor macro that is only defined if compiling for Linux.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_platform_defines.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_platform_defines.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_PLATFORM_LINUX 1
```

## Remarks

Note that Android, although ostensibly a Linux-based system, will not
define this. It defines [SDL_PLATFORM_ANDROID](SDL_PLATFORM_ANDROID)
instead.

## Version

This macro is available since SDL 3.2.0.

## (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is the current stable version. [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) was the previous version!)
