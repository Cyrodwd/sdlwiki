# SDL_StorageReady

## Header File

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_StorageReady(SDL_Storage *storage);
```

## Function Parameters

|                              |             |                               |

| [SDL_Storage](SDL_Storage) * | **storage** | a storage container to query. |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true if the container is ready, false otherwise.

## Remarks

This function should be called in regular intervals until it returns true -
however, it is not recommended to spinwait on this call, as the backend may
depend on a synchronous message loop.

## Version
