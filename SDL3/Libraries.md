# Libraries

These libraries can extend the core SDL functionality.

Please note that several of these have names that start with "SDL_", but none of them are part of the core SDL library. They are _separate_ and _optional_ extras!

## Dear ImGUI:

Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).

- [Example source code](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples/example_sdl_sdlrenderer)


## RmlUI (fork of libRocket):

RmlUi is the C++ user interface package based on the HTML and CSS standards, designed as a complete solution for any project's interface needs. It is a fork of the libRocket project, introducing new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
