| [SDL_Process](SDL_Process) * | **process** | The process to stop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| bool                         | **force**   | true to terminate the process immediately, false to try to stop the process gracefully. In general you should try to stop the process gracefully first as terminating a process may leave it with half-written data or in some other unstable state. |
