# SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface

Create a Vulkan rendering surface for a window.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_vulkan.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_vulkan.h)

## Syntax

```c
bool SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface(SDL_Window *window,
                                  VkInstance instance,
                                  const struct VkAllocationCallbacks *allocator,
                                  VkSurfaceKHR* surface);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                      |               |                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) *           | **window**    | the window to which to attach the Vulkan surface.                                                           |
| VkInstance                           | **instance**  | the Vulkan instance handle.                                                                                 |
| const struct VkAllocationCallbacks * | **allocator** | a VkAllocationCallbacks struct, which lets the app set the allocator that creates the surface. Can be NULL. |
| VkSurfaceKHR *                       | **surface**   | a pointer to a VkSurfaceKHR handle to output the newly created surface.                                     |

## Return Value

(bool) Returns true on success or false on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

The `window` must have been created with the
[`SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN`](SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN) flag and `instance` must have been
created with extensions returned by
[SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions](SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions)()
enabled.

If `allocator` is NULL, Vulkan will use the system default allocator. This
argument is passed directly to Vulkan and isn't used by SDL itself.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
