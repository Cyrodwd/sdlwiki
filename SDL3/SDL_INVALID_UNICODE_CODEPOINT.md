# SDL_INVALID_UNICODE_CODEPOINT

The Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER codepoint.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_INVALID_UNICODE_CODEPOINT 0xFFFD
```

## Remarks

[SDL_StepUTF8](SDL_StepUTF8)() reports this codepoint when it encounters a
UTF-8 string with encoding errors.

This tends to render as something like a question mark in most places.

## Version

This macro is available since SDL 3.0.0.
