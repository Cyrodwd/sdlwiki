# SDL_rand_bits_r

Generate 32 pseudo-random bits.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
Uint32 SDL_rand_bits_r(Uint64 *state);
```

## Function Parameters

|          |           |                                                                     |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uint64 * | **state** | a pointer to the current random number state, this may not be NULL. |

## Return Value

(Uint32) Returns a random value in the range of
[0-[SDL_MAX_UINT32](SDL_MAX_UINT32)].

## Remarks

You likely want to use [SDL_rand_r](SDL_rand_r)() to get a psuedo-random
number instead.

There are no guarantees as to the quality of the random sequence produced,
and this should not be used for security (cryptography, passwords) or where
money is on the line (loot-boxes, casinos). There are many random number
libraries available with different characteristics and you should pick one
of those to meet any serious needs.

## Thread Safety

This function is thread-safe, as long as the state pointer isn't shared
between threads.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
