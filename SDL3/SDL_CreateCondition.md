// BEWARE: This code example was migrated from the SDL2 Wiki, by only updating the names.

bool condition = false;
SDL_Mutex *lock;
SDL_Condition *cond;
lock = SDL_CreateMutex();
cond = SDL_CreateCondition();


Thread_A:
    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
    while (!condition) {
        SDL_WaitCondition(cond, lock);
    }
    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);
Thread_B:
    SDL_LockMutex(lock);
    /* ... */
    condition = true;
    /* ... */
    SDL_SignalCondition(cond);
    SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);

SDL_DestroyCondition(cond);
SDL_DestroyMutex(lock);
```
